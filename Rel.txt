Ant 1.5.4
This is the 1.5.4 version of Ant. It is available in both
binary and source distributions.
JDK 1.1 Users:
Please note that the next major release of Ant, Ant 1.6, will require JDK 1.2 or
later. This release, Ant 1.5.4, will be the last Ant release from the Ant 1.5
codebase, barring any major bugs. As such, it is likely to be the last
release of Ant that will be JDK 1.1 compatible. Ant 1.6, of course, retains the
ability to generate 1.1 compatible code.
Note:
The tar files in the distribution use GNU tar extensions
and must be untarred with a GNU compatible version of tar. The version
of tar on Solaris and Mac OS X will not work with these files
Changes
The changes from Release 1.5.3 to this release are detailed below.
Please refer to the WHATSNEW file for more information.
Thank you for using Ant.

PGP Signatures
Many of the distribution kits have been digitally signed (using
PGP).
If so, there will be an accompanying
distribution.asc file in the same directory as
the distribution.
The PGP keys can be found in the distribution
directory at <http://www.apache.org/dist/ant/KEYS>.
Always test available signatures, e.g.,
> pgpk -a KEYS
> pgpv apache-ant-1.5.4-bin.tar.gz.asc
or,
> pgp -ka KEYS
> pgp apache-ant-1.5.4-bin.tar.gz.asc
or,
> gpg --import KEYS
> gpg --verify apache-ant-1.5.4-bin.tar.gz.asc
Changes from Ant 1.5.3 to Ant 1.5.4
Changes that could break older environments:
If the Visual Age tasks used to work for you, they may stop doing so
now - and we'd like to know about it.
The current set of tasks is
supposed to work with any version of VAJ starting with 3.0.
Fixed bugs:
The Visual Age for Java tasks didn't work (at least for versions 3.0
and higher).
Bugzilla Report 10016.
URL-encoding in <vaj*port> didn't work properly.
VAJRemoteUtil called getAbsolutePath instead of getPath
causing problems when using a Windows VAJ server from a UNIX server.
Bugzilla Report 20457.
VAJImport task failed with NullPointerException when using DirectoryScanner.
Bugzilla Report 22080.
Other Changes:
Shipped XML parser is now Xerces 2.5.0
<javah> will invoke oldjavah on JDK 1.4.2.
Bugzilla Report 18667.
The VAJ tasks now support a haltonfailure attribute to conditionally
keep building even if they fail.
It is now possible to use the latest (versioned or unversioned) edition
in <vajload> by using special wildcard characters.
Also fixes
Bugzilla Report 2236.
