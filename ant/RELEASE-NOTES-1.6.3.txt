Ant 1.6.3 release notes
Changes from Ant 1.6.2 to Ant 1.6.3
Changes that could break older environments:
The subant task used the canonical version of a file path. This
has been changed to use the absolute path. Bugzilla 30438.
Tar now writes two EOF blocks rather than one.
Bugzilla report 28776
The Reference object now has a project field which it uses in preference
to the project passed in. This allows composite references to be
handled to nested projects.
Bugzilla report 25777
<junit> with filtertrace="true" will now also swallow lines for the
sun.reflect package.
If you need to see them in your stack trace,
you must set filtertrace to false.
Bugzilla Report 22758
The jikes compiler adapter now supports -bootclasspath, -extdirs and
-sourcepath and also uses the same logic for debug flags as javac.
This means, the jikes compiler adapter now requires Jikes 1.15 or later.
Bugzilla Reports 25868, 26404 and 32609.
Targets with identical name work in imported project. Bugzilla Report 34566.
The gcj compiler adapter used to include the Java runtime classes
even if includeJavaRuntime was set to false, unless the
bootclasspath has been specified as well.
It will now always adhere
to includeJavaRuntime, you may need to set it to true explicitly now
if you relied on the old behavior.
Other changes:
<javadoc> can now take an attribute 'executable'. Bugzilla report 30606.
New attribute ignorecontents for <different> selector
Javadoc fixes for Location, Project, and RuntimeConfigurable
Bugzilla 30160.
Enable to choose the regexp implementation without system property.
Bugzilla Report 15390.
Expose objects and methods in IntrospectionHelper. Bugzilla Report 30794.
Allow file attribute of <move> to rename a directory.
Bugzilla Report 22863.
Add xmlcatalog nested element to XmlProperty. Bugzilla report 27053.
New attribute alwayslog for <redirector> type.
Added <target> nested elements to <ant> and <antcall> to allow
specification of multiple sub-build targets, which are executed
with a single dependency analysis.
Refactored Target invocation into org.apache.tools.ant.Executor
implementations.
Bugzilla Reports 21421, 29248.
<rmic> now also supports Kaffe's rmic version shipping with Kaffe
1.1.2 and above.
added casesensitive attribute to <globmapper> and <regexpmapper>
Bugzilla report 16686
added handledirsep attribute to <globmapper> and <regexpmapper>
Bugzilla report 32487
added a new mapper <filtermapper>
When a BuildListener tried to access System.err or System.out, Ant
would have thrown an exception - this has been changed.
Ant now
silently ignores the message.
BuildListeners still should avoid
accessing either stream.
Added a comment attribute to the zip task.
Bugzilla report 22793.
Overloaded FileUtils.createNewFile with a boolean mkdirs attribute
to create nonexistent parent directories.
<apply> has a new "force" attribute that, when true, disables
checking of target files.
Made the dest attribute of the apply task optional; mapped target
filenames will be interpreted as absolute pathnames when dest is omitted.
Changed default tempdir for <javac> from user.dir to java.io.tmpdir.
Added searchpath attribute to <exec> for searching path variable(s)
when resolveexecutable = true.
Added revision and userid attributes to <pvcs> documentation.
Added support to the touch task for a mkdirs attribute to create
nonexistent parent directories before touching new files.
Added support to the touch task for a pattern attribute to allow
alternate datetime formats.
Added support to the touch task to map touched files using a nested
mapper element.
Added support to the touch task for a verbose attribute to suppress
logging of new file creation.
bad link in docs to the enhancement page in bugzilla.
Bugzilla report 33252.
Added length task to get strings' and files' lengths.
<native2ascii> and <javah> now also support Kaffe's versions.
Recursive token expansion in a filterset can now be disabled by
setting its recurse attribute to false.
Pathconvert no longer requires that one of (targetos|pathsep|dirsep)
be set; platform defaults are used when this is the case.
Added preservelastmodified attribute to fixcrlf task. Bugzilla 25770.
Added isfileselected condition.
Added verbose="true|false" attribute to <subant>. When verbose is enabled,
the directory name is logged on entry and exit of the sub-build. Bugzilla 33787.
Added -nouserlib option to allow running ant without automatically loading
up ${user.home}/.lib/ant. This is useful when compiling ant, and antlibs.
Modified the build.sh and build.bat to use the option.
Added -noclasspath option to allow running ant WITHOUT using CLASSPATH env
variable. Modified ant.bat to do this so that %CLASSPATH% is not looked at.
Add else attribute to the condition task, which specifies an
optional alternate value to set the property to if the nested
condition evaluates to false. Bugzilla report 33074.
Ant generated jar files should now be detected as jar files by
Solaris.
Bugzilla Report 32649.
Added two tutorials
