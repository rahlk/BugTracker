Release notes of Apache Ant (TM) 1.8.2
Changes from Ant 1.8.1 TO Ant 1.8.2
===================================
Changes that could break older environments:
-------------------------------------------
* Prior to Ant 1.8.0 the <copy> task and several other tasks would
overwrite read-only destination files.
Starting with 1.8.0 they
would only do so under special circumstances.
Ant 1.8.2 now
consistently won't replace a read-only file by default. The same is
true for a number of other tasks.
The <copy>, <move> and <echo> tasks now have a new force attribute
and <concat> has a new forceReadonly attribute that can be used to
make the task overwrite read-only destinations.
Bugzilla Report 49261.
* Removed ant-nodeps.jar; it is now merged into ant.jar.
* DOMElementWriter#encode used to employ special code before encoding
ampersands so that &#123; remained &#123; rather than being turned
into &amp;#123;.
This is no longer the case, ampersands will now
be encoded unconditionally.
Also DOMElementWriter#encodeData will treat CDATA sections containing a
literal "]]>" sequence different now - it will split the CDATA
section between the second "]" and ">" and create two sections.
This affects <echoxml> task as well as the XML logger or JUnit
formatter where ampersands will now always get encoded.
In addition DOMElementWriter will now replace the characters \t, \r
and \n in attribute values by entity references.
Bugzilla Report 49404.
* The list elements returned by ProjectHelper#getExtensionStack are
now String arrays of length 3 rather than 2 in order to support the
onMissingExtensionPoint attribute.
Bugzilla Report 49473.
* When using <property file="..." prefix="..."/> properties defined
inside the same file will only get used in expansions if the ${}
reference uses the same prefix.
This is different from Ant 1.8.1
but is the same behavior Ant 1.8.0 and earlier exhibited.
A new attribute prefixValues can be used to re-enable the behavior
of Ant 1.8.1.
Bugzilla Report 49373.
* The files and directories used by Git, Mercurial and Bazaar to
store their information are now excluded by the defaultexcludes.
Bugzilla Report 49624.
* The <junit> task no longer generates TestListener events - which
have been introduced in ant 1.7.0 - by default.
The task has a new
attribute enableTestListenerEvents and a new "magic" property
ant.junit.enabletestlistenerevents has been added that can be used
to reinstate the old behavior.
Fixed bugs:
-----------
* hostinfo now prefers addresses with a hostname over addresses without
a hostname, provided the addresses have the same scope.
For local lookup, no IP address will be put in NAME / DOMAIN anymore.
For remote lookup, if a host name was provided and only an IP address is
found, the IP address will no longer overwrite the host name provided to the
task.
Bugzilla Report 49513
* mmap-based file copy problems under JDK 1.4 on Linux.
Bugzilla Report 49430.
* The Sun JVM tries to mmap the entire file during a copy.
For large files this is not feasible.
We now explicitly request to copy at most 16 MiB per request.
Bugzilla Report 49326.
* DemuxInputStream.read() should return unsigned values
Bugzilla Report 49279.
* The MIME mailer ignored the port parameter when using SSL.
Bugzilla Report 49267.
* <xslt> ignored the classpath when using the default TraX processor.
Bugzilla Report 49271.
* <checksum>'s totalproperty only worked reliably if the same file
name didn't occur inside more than one directory.
Bugzilla Report 36748.
* <ftp> could fail to download files from remote subdirectories under
certain circumstances.
Bugzilla Report 49296.
* <junit> will now produce better diagnostics when it fails to delete
a temporary file.
Bugzilla Report 49419.
* Ant would often scan directories even though there were known to
only hold excluded files when evaluating filesets.
This never
resulted in wrong results but degraded performance of the scan
itself.
Bugzilla Report 49420.
* <javac> failed for long command lines on OS/2.
Bugzilla Report 49425.
* <junitreport> did not handle encodings well for stdout/stderr.
Bugzilla Report 49418.
* <junit> could issue a warning about multiple versions of Ant on the
CLASSPATH if two CLASSPATH entries differed in case on a
case-insensitive file system.
Bugzilla Report 49041.
* The <restrict> resource collection was checking every resource even if
we actually just want the first one, like in the example of use of
resourcelist in the documentation (getting the first available resource
from a mirror list).
* A race condition could lead to build failures if multiple <mkdir>
tasks were trying to create the same directory.
Bugzilla Report 49572.
* the toString() method of the Resources class - and thus any
${toString:} expansion of a reference to a <resources> element -
didn't iterate over its nested elements if it hadn't done so prior
to the toString invocation already.
Bugzilla Report 49588.
* <apply> in parallel mode didn't work together with a nested
<redirector> if maxparallel was <= 0 (the default) or no source
files matched.
Bugzilla Report 49594.
* <jar filesetmanifest="merge"> didn't work for manifests added via
<zipfileset>s that used the prefix or fullpath attributes.
Bugzilla Report 49605.
* <tempfile createfile="true"> would cause an error unless the prefix
attribute has been specified.
Bugzilla Report 49755.
* If forked, after finished <java> was still reading the input stream
for a bunch of characters, then stealing them from a following <input>.
Bugzilla Report 49119.
* Ant could be leaking threads for each forked process (started by
<exec>, <apply>, <java> or similar tasks) that didn't receive input
from a resource or string explicitly.
Bugzilla Report 49587.
* Project#setDefault threw an exception when null was passed in as
argument, even though the javadoc says, null is a valid value.
Bugzilla Report 49803.
* runant.py would swallow the first argument if CLASSPATH wasn't set.
Bugzilla Report 49963.
* <taskdef> failed to load resources from jar files contained in a
directory that has a "!" in its name.
Bugzilla Report 50007.
* ant.bat exit strategy improvements and issues
make the exit codes work in environments where 4NT or MKS are installed
Bugzilla Report 41039.
* <signjar> would fail if used via its Java API and the File passed
into the setJar method was not "normalized" (i.e. contained ".."
segments).
Bugzilla Report 50081.
* <delete> ignored <fileset>'s errorOnMissingDir attribute
Bugzilla Report 50124.
* <symlink> failed to close files when reading a list of symbolic
links from a properties file.
Bugzilla Report 50136.
* <parallel> could allow tasks to start executing even if a task
scheduled to run before them timed out.
Bugzilla Report 49527.
* If a <junit> batch with multiple tests times out Ant logs a message
about a test named Batch-With-Multiple-Tests since 1.8.0 but the
logic that determined the Java package of this pseudo-test has been
wrong.
Bugzilla Report 45227.
* <propertyfile> didn't preserve the original linefeed style when
updating a file.
Bugzilla Report 50049.
* <zip>'s whenEmpty behavior never consulted the non-fileset
resources so the task could fail even though resources have been
provided using non-fileset resource collections.
Bugzilla Issue 50115.
*
ftp chmod could throw a NPE.
Bugzilla report 50217.
*
The project help (-p option in the command line) will now print
the dependencies of the targets in debug mode (-d on the command
line)
Other changes:
--------------
* <concat>'s force attribute has been deprecated in favor of a new
overwrite attribute that is consistent with <copy>'s attribute
names.
* You can now specify a list of methods to run in a JUnit test case.
Bugzilla Report 34748.
* properties in files read because of the -propertyfile command line
option will now get resolved against other properties that are
defined before the project starts executing (those from the same or
earlier -propertfiles or defined via the -D option).
Bugzilla Report 18732.
* <pathelement>s can now contain wildcards in order to use wildcard
CLASSPATH entries introduced with Java6.
The wildcards are not expanded or even evaluated by Ant and will be
used literally.
The resulting path may be unusable as a CLASSPATH
for Java versions prior to Java6 and likely doesn't mean anything
when used in any other way than a CLASSPATH for a forked Java VM.
Bugzilla Report 46842.
* A new attribute allows targets to deal with non-existant extensions
points, i.e. they can extend and extension-point if it has been
defined or silently work as plain targets if it hasn't.
This is
useful for targets that get included/imported in different
scenarios where a given extension-point may or may not exist.
Bugzilla Report 49473.
* Ant now logs a warning message if it fails to change the file
modification time in for example when using <touch> or preserving
timestamps in various tasks.
Bugzilla Report 49485.
* ProjectHelpers can now be installed dynamically via the <projecthelper>
Ant task.
* <import> is now able to switch to the proper ProjectHelper to parse
the imported resource. This means that several kinds of different build
files can import each other.
* <copy tofile=""> now also works for non-filesystem resources.
Bugzilla Report 49756.
* The <linecontainsregexp> filter now supports a casesensitive
attribute.
* The <containsregexp> selector now supports casesensitive, multiline
and singleline attributes.
Bugzilla Report 49764.
* A new <cutdirsmapper> can be used like wget's --cut-dirs option to
strip leading directories from file names.
* <javah> now supports the GNU project's gcjh compiler.
Bugzilla Report 50149.
* <checksum> supports additional views of a file's path as elements
for a custom pattern.
Bugzilla Report 50114.
* JUnit XMLResultAggregator logs the stack trace of caught IO exceptions
in verbose runs.
Bugzilla Report 48836.
* StringUtils.parseHumanSizes() should turn parse failures into
BuildExceptions.
Bugzilla Report 48835.
* New task <bindtargets> to make a list of targets bound to some
specified extension point.
* Initial support for OpenJDK7 has been added.
* Ant now uses java.net.CookieStore rather than
java.util.ServiceLocator to detect whether the environment is a
Java 1.6 system.
This means releases of gcj/gij at the time of
this release of Ant are detected as Java 1.5 and not 1.6.
Bugzilla Report 50256.
* It is now possible to write a compiler adapter for <javac> that
compiles sources with extensions other than .java (but that still
compile to .class files).
Bugzilla Report 48829.
* The performance of VectorSet#add(Object) has been improved which
should also benefit any operation that scans directories in Ant.
Bugzilla Report 50200.
