Changes from Ant 1.8.4 TO Ant 1.9.0
===================================
Changes that could break older environments:
-------------------------------------------
* Ant now requires at least Java 1.5 to compile and to run
* FixCRLF used to treat the EOL value ASIS to convert to the system property
line.separator. Specified was that ASIS would leave the EOL characters alone,
the task now really leaves the EOL characters alone. This also implies that
EOL ASIS will not insert a newline even if fixlast is set to true.
Bugzilla report 53036
* The CommandLauncher hierarchy that used to be a set of inner
classes of Execute has been extracted to the
org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.launcher package.
* Any FileResource whose represented File has a parent also has a basedir.
* Removing the Perforce Ant tasks replaced by tasks supplied by Perforce Inc.
* Setting the default encoding of StringResource to UTF-8 instead of null
* Upgrade JUnit 4 to JUnit 4.11

Other changes:
--------------
* merged the ZIP package from Commons Compress, it can now read
archives using Zip64 extensions (files and archives bigger that 4GB
and with more that 64k entries).
* a new task <commandlaucher> can be used to configure the
CommandLauncher used by Ant when forking external programs or new
Java VMs.
Bugzilla Report 52706.
* merged the TAR package from Commons Compress, it can now read
archives using POSIX extension headers and STAR extensions.
* merged the BZIP2 package from Commons Compress, it can now
optionally read files that contain multiple streams properly.
* <bunzip2> will now properly expand files created by pbzip2 and
similar tools that create files with multiple bzip2 streams.
* <tar> now supports a new "posix" option for longfile-mode which
will make it create PAX extension headers for long file names.
PAX
extension headers are supported by all modern implementations of
tar including GNU tar.
This option should now be used in preference to "warn" or "gnu" as
it is more portable.
For backwards compatibility reasons "warn"
will still create "gnu" extensions rather than "posix" extensions.
* The ProjectHelper class now exposes a method to be used by third party
implementations to properly resolve the binding between target extensions
and extension points.
Bugzilla Report 53549.
* Make extension point bindable to imported prefixed targets
Bugzilla Report 53550.
* Add the possibility to register a custom command line argument processor.
See org.apache.tools.ant.ArgumentProcessor and manual/argumentprocessor.html
* add the possibility to suppress stdout in the sshexec task.
Bugzilla Report 50270.
* add an encoding attribute to the contains selector.
This will be useful to use the contains selector if the encoding of the VM is different from the encoding
of the files being selected.
