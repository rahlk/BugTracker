Release Notes of Apache Ant 1.7.1
Release Notes of Apache Ant 1.7.1
Changes that could break older environments:
String resources only have properties single expanded. If you relied on
<string> resources being expanded more than once, it no longer happens.
Bugzilla report 42277.
A String resource's encoding attribute was only taken into account when
set from the resource's OutputStream; the InputStream provided the String's
binary content according to the platform's default encoding. Behavior has
been modified to encode outgoing (InputStream) content as well as encoding
incoming (OutputStream) content.
<java> with fork now returns gives -1 instead of 0 as result when failonerror
is false and some exception (including timeout) occurs. Br 42377.
ant-type attribute has been marked as deprecated and a warning has been
issued if it is encountered in the build file.
FileUtils.createTempFile now actually creates the file.
The TempFile task still does not create the file by default, can be instructed
to do so however using a new parameter.
Bugzilla report 33969.
Fixed bugs:
The default logger was failing to print complete stack traces for exceptions
other than BuildException, thus omitting often important diagnostic
information. Bugzilla 43398.

The changes have been modified so that
subclases should now work again - without any changes to the
subclass.
Other changes:
Various small optimizations speed up common tasks such as <javac> on large
filesets, reducing both I/O and CPU usage.
Profiling logger has been added with basic profiling capabilities.
<script> now has basic support for JavaFX scripts
SSH task can now take a command parameter containing the commands to execute.
This allows you to connect to a server and execute a number of commands
without constantly reconnecting for each command.
Upgraded XML API to XML commons version 1.3.04.
Upgraded to Xerces 2.9.0
<script> can now work with bsf.jar and js.jar in its <classpath>.
add errorProperty and updatedProperty to <javac>

Bugzilla 29154
Show Previous Revision in the tagdiff.xsl stylesheet
Bugzilla 29143
Allow <mapper refid> to refer directly to a FileNameMapper instance.
If you try and use a type in a namespace (or an antlib), and the type is not
recognized but there are other definitions in that namespace, Ant lists what
the known definitions are. This helps you find spelling errors.
Add a <last> resource collection, corresponding to <first>.
Add new <truncate> task.
<junitreport> xsl stylesheets allow setting the title used in <title> and <h1> tags by
using <report><param> element.
Bugzilla 41742.

only the targets explicitly specified.

JUnitVersionHelper.getTestCaseClassName is now public. Bugzilla 42231
<string> resource supports nested text. Bugzilla bug 42276
<scriptdef> now sources scripts from nested resources/resource collections. This lets you
define scripts in JARs, remote URLs, or any other supported resource. Bugzilla report 41597.
<concat> is now usable as a single-element ResourceCollection.
It is now possible to provide the value of a <striplinecomments> filter's
<comment> nested element as nested text instead of using the 'value'
attribute.
A new logger, BigProjectLogger, lists the project name with every target
Default text added to macrodef. Bugzilla report 42301.
"rawblobs" attribute added to SQL task.
Add new retry task container.
<jar> has a new strict attribute that checks if the jar complies with
the jar packaging version specification.
<javac> has a new attribute - includeDestClasses.
Bugzilla 40776.

Bugzilla 11270.
<javac> handles package-info.java files, there were repeatedly compiled.
Bugzilla 43114.
