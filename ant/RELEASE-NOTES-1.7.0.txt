Release Notes of Ant 1.7.0
Changes from Ant 1.6.5 to Ant 1.7.0
Changes that could break older environments:
Initial support for JDK 6 (JSR 223) scripting.
<script> tasks will now use javax.scripting if BSF is
not available, or if explicitly requested by using
a "manager" attribute.
Removed launcher classes from nodeps jar.
<classconstants> filter reader uses ISO-8859-1 encoding to read
the java class file. Bugzilla report 33604.
Defer reference process. Bugzilla 36955, 34458, 37688.
This may break build files in which a reference was set in a target which was
never executed. Historically, Ant would set the reference early on, during parse
time, so the datatype would be defined. Now it requires the reference to have
been in a bit of the build file which was actually executed. If you get
an error about an undefined reference, locate the reference and move it somewhere
where it is used, or fix the depends attribute of the target in question to
depend on the target which defines the reference/datatype.
<script> and <scriptdef> now set the current thread context.
Unrestrict the dbvendor names in the websphere element of the ejbjar task.
Bugzilla Report 40475.
<env> nested element in <java>, <exec> and others is now case-insensitive
for windows OS. Bugzilla Report 28874.
Removed support for xalan1 completely. Users of Xalan1 for Ant builds will
have to stay at ant 1.6.5 or upgrade to xalan2.
Use org.apache.log4j.Logger instead of org.apache.log4j.Category.
Category has been deprecated for ~2 years and has been removed from
the log4j code.
Logger was introduced in log4j 1.2 so users of
log4j 1.1 and log4j 1.0 need to upgrade to a newer version of log4j.
Bugzilla Report 31951.
build.sysclasspath now also affects the bootclasspath handling of
spawned Java VMs.
If you set build.sysclasspath to anything other
than "ignore" (or leave it unset, since "ignore" is the default when
it comes to bootclasspath handling), then the bootclasspath of the
VM running Ant will be added to the bootclasspath you've specified.
The <java fork="false"> now as per default installs a security manager
using the default permissions. This is now independent of the
failonerror attribute.
Bugzilla report 33361.
<signjar> now notices when the jar and signedjar are equal, and switches
to the same dependency logic as when signedjar is omitted. This may break
something that depended upon signing in this situation. However, since
invoking the JDK jarsigner program with -signedjar set to the source jar
actually crashes the JVM on our (Java1.5) systems, we don't think any
build files which actually worked will be affected by the change.
<signjar> used to ignore a nested fileset when a jar was also provided as an
attribute, printing a warning message; now it signs files in the fileset.
An improved method of handling timestamp granularity differences between
client and server was added to the <ftp> task.
FTP servers typically
have HH:mm timestamps whereas local filesystems have HH:mm:ss timestamps.
Previously, this required tweaking with the timediffmillis attribute
which also was used to handle timezone differences.
Now, there is a new
timestampgranularity attribute.
The default value for get operations is 0
since the user has the more powerful preservelastmodified attribute to work
with.
Since this is not available on put operations the default value
adds a minute to the server timestamp in order to account for this,
Scripts which previously used timediffmillis to do this compensation may
need to be rewritten.
timediffmillis has now been deprecated.
Support for the XSL:P XML parser has been removed.
Bugzilla Report 23455.
Visual Age for Java optional tasks removed as the required library is no
longer available.
Testlet (test) optional task removed as the required library is no
longer available.
IContract optional task removed as the required library is no
longer available.
Metamata (maudit, mmetrics, and mparse tasks) removed as the required
library is no longer available.
Sitraka (jpcoverage, jpcovmerge, jpcovreport) tasks suppressed as the
required library is no longer available.
<fixcrlf> used \r (Mac) line endings on OS X, whose proper line separator
is \n (Unix).
Bugzilla report 39585.
<scp> now optionally supports the sftp protocol, you may need a
newer jsch.jar.
Bugzilla Report 39373.
Ant launcher program prints errors to stderr, and exits with a 2 exit code
value if, for any reason, it cannot actually start Ant proper. This will only
affect programs/scripts that called the launcher and which did not want to
receive an error if Ant itself would not start

ant.bat now looks in %USERPROFILE% and %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH% in addition to
%HOME% for pre/post batch files. Bugzilla report 39298.
The inheritance hierarchy of the legacy <path> type was changed; code built
against Ant 1.7 would therefore no longer execute on older versions of Ant.
Since <path> is historically heavily used this was undesirable, and since it
is also avoidable, the change to <path>'s taxonomy was reverted.

<xslt> passes the current file (name + directory) to the
stylesheet/transformation.
xsl-parameter name is configurable.

Create a pom file for ant-testutil and add ant-testutil.jar to the ant
distribution. Bugzilla 40980.
Roll back automatic proxy enabling on Java 1.5. It broke things like
Oracle JDBC drivers, and Ant itself on IBM's JVM on AIX, and didnt
seem to work to well the rest of the time.
To enable the feature, use the -autoproxy command line option.
Upgraded XML API and parser to Xerces 2.8.1
A code review of some threaded logic has tightened up the synchronization
of Watchdog, ExecuteWatchdog and ExecuteJava, which could reduce the occurence
of race conditions here, especially on Java1.5+.

break too many files - so allow them with a warning.
Removed dependency on sun.misc.UUEncoder for UUMailer.
Added regex attribute to the echoproperties task.
Bugzilla 40019.

On DOS and Netware, filenames beginning with a drive letter
and followed by a colon but with no directory separator following
the colon are no longer (incorrectly) accepted as absolute pathnames
by FileUtils.normalize() and FileUtils.isAbsolutePath().
Netware
volumes can still be specified without an intervening separator.
UNC pathnames on Windows must include a server and share name, i.e.
"\\a\b" to be considered valid absolute paths.
A bug in SQLExec would prevent the execution of trailing,
non-semicolon-delimited statements.
Bugzilla Report 37764.

-tsaurl and tsacert attributes for timestamped JAR signing
-nested <sysproperty> elements, which can be used for proxy setup
and the like
The linecontains and linecontainsregexp filterreaders now support a
negate attribute to select lines -not- containing specified text.
Bugzilla Report 34374.
<os> condition adds "winnt" as a family which can be tested. This is
all windows platforms other than the Win9x line or Windows CE.

attribute, which can restrict execution to a single OS family.
Added "backtrace" attribute to macrodef. Bugzilla report 27219.
Ant main provides some diagnostics if it ever sees a -cp or -lib option,
as this is indicative of a script mismatch. Bugzilla report 34860
<junitreport> prints a special message if supplied an empty XML File. This
can be caused by the test JVM exiting during a test, either via a
System.exit() call or a JVM crash.
Project name is now used for all targets so one can write consistent import
build files. Bugzilla report 28444.
New condition <typefound> that can be used to probe for the declaration
and implementation of a task, type, preset, macro, scriptdef, whatever.
As it tests for the implementation, it can be used to check for optional
tasks being available.
Check for 1.5.* Ant main class. (weblogic.jar in classpath reports)
New condition <isfailure> that tests the return-code of an executable. This
contains platform-specific logic and is better than comparing the result with
"0".

resourcecount task.
property attribute of pathconvert is now optional. If omitted the
result will be written to the log.
New mapper, <scriptmapper>, supports scripted mapping of source files/strings
to destination strings.

the normal <?xml ?> processor instruction. UTF-8 encoding only; no-namespace
support.
Try to make subprojects of custom Project subclasses instances of the
same type. Bugzilla report 17901.

New <resourcesmatch> condition.
Added the onmissingfiltersfile attribute to filterset. Bugzilla report 19845.
Added the inline handler element to the input task.
<sql> supports property expansion if you set the expandProperties
attribute. By default it does not expand properties, something we
dare not change for fear of breaking complex SQL operations in
existing files.
<javadoc>'s packagenames attribute is now optional and defaults to "*".
<javac>'s source and target attributes as well as <javadoc>'s source
attribute will read default values from the properties
ant.build.javac.source and ant.build.javac.target.
