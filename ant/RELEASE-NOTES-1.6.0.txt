Changes from Ant 1.5.4 to Ant 1.6
Changes that could break older environments:
This version of Ant can not be built with JDK 1.1 and requires at
least Java 1.2 at runtime as well.
Compiling for a 1.1 target is
still supported.
Targets cannot have the empty string as their name any longer.
ant.jar's manifest does no longer include a Class-Path entry, so it
is no longer possible to run Ant via "java -jar ant.jar" without
manually altering the CLASSPATH.
Instead of that a file
ant-bootstrap.jar is included in the etc directory of the binary
distribution, copy this to the lib directory and use
"java -jar ant-bootstrap.jar" instead if you want to run Ant without
the wrapper script (not recommended).
The <script> task now requires Apache BSF instead of the older IBM
version.
See <http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf/>
<xmlproperty> will no longer fail if the file to be loaded doesn't exist.
XML namespaces are now enabled in the XML parser, meaning XML namespace
declarations no longer cause errors. However task names containing colons
will cause errors unless there is a corresponding namespace uri.
The <ftp> and <telnet> tasks now require Jakarta Commons Net instead
of the older ORO Netcomponents version.
See
<http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/net/index.html>.
<input> will no longer prompt the user and wait for input if the
addproperty attribute is set to a property that has already been
defined in the project.
If you rely on the task waiting for input,
don't use the addproperty attribute.
The Class-Path attribute in manifests will no longer merge the
entries of all manifests found, but will be treated like all other
manifest attributes - the most recent attribute(s) will be used.
New Launch mechanism implemented. This moves some functionality from
the batch files / shell scripts into Java. This removes environment
limitations, for command issues, directory depth issues on Windows. Also
allows a per-user library location to be used if the main Ant install
is locked down.
The Entry nested element of PropertyFile will not any more have its value
attribute (actually increment) overwritten with the new value of the entry
after execution.
Output stored from a <java> or <exec> task is now exactly as generated. No
conversion to platform end-of-line characters is performed.
<translate> will now preserve line endings.
<ftp> followsymlinks="false" in nested fileset definitions is explicitly
required in order to exclude remote symbolic links (when doing a get, chmod,
delete, rmdir).
The values of the Copy#fileCopyMap variable has changed from String to
String[]. (In java 1.5 terms it was Hashtable<String, String> and
is now Hashtable<String, String[]>). This will affect third party code
that extend Copy and override Copy#doFileOperations.
<loadproperties> didn't expand properties while <property file="..."/>
does, so they were not equivalent.
This has been fixed, which means
that propetries may get expanded twice if you use an
<expandproperties> filterreader.
Bugzilla Report 17782.
User defined tasks and typedefs are now handled internally in the
same way as predefined tasks and typedefs. Also tasks and typedefs
are resolved at a later stage. This causes some
differences especially for user defined task containers.
<checksum> log message "Calculating checksum ..." has been degraded from INFO to VERBOSE.
Fixed bugs:
Filter readers were not handling line endings properly.
Bugzilla
Report 18476.
Filtersets were also not handling line endings properly.
Expand tasks did not behave as expected with PatternSets.
<property environment=... /> now works on OS/400.
<cab> could hang listcab on large <fileset>s.
The starteam stcheckout, stcheckin tasks now correctly compute
status of files against whatever local tree they are run against
and, optionally, will not process a file if it is current.
Previously you had to process everything unless you ran against the
default folder which wasn't the normal use-case for ant-starteam.
The stlist task now similarly displays that status correctly making
it a more generally useful tool.
entity includes would cause exceptions if path names included spaces.
addConfiguredXXX would not work for TaskAdapter wrapped tasks
Fix <ilasm> outputfile testing so that the output file does not need
to exist beforehand.
Ant will now exit with a return code of 1 if it encounters problems
with the command line arguments.
ClassLoader creation changes to use a factory method in Project. A new
class AntClassLoader2 implemented for 1.2+ specific features including
Package information and addition of classes specified in the Class-Path
element of a Jar's manifest.
It is now possible in <exec> to resolve the executable to a project
basedir or execution dir relative executable. The resolveExecutable
must be used to pick up such executables.
splash screen wouldn't disappear when build was finished.
<exec> output and error streams can now be redirected independently
to either a property or a file (or both)
TarEntry's File-arg constructor would fail with a
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException on all OSes where os.name is shorter
than seven characters.
Bugzilla Report 18105.
<copy> and <move>'s failonerror didn't apply to filesets pointing to
non-existant directories.
Bugzilla Report 18414.
The <stripjavacomments> filter sometimes removed parts of string
constants.
Bugzilla Report 17441.
<antlr> will now recompile your grammar if the supergrammar has
changed.
Bugzilla Report 12691.
<property env> will now work on Unices with /bin/env instead of
/usr/bin/env.
Bugzilla Report 17642.
<jar index="on"> could include multiple index lists.
Bugzilla 10262.
The index created by <jar> didn't conform to the spec as it didn't
include the top-level entries.
Bugzilla Report 16972.
<tar> and <zip> didn't honor the defaultexcludes attribute for the
implicit fileset.
Bugzilla Report 18637.
The <replacetokens> filter would throw an exception if the token's
value was an empty string.
Bugzilla Report 18625.
Perforce tasks relying on output from the server such as <p4change>
and <p4label> were hanging. Bugzilla Reports 18129 and 18956.
Improve exception and logging behavior of Perforce tasks.

and the message says that file(s) need to be resolved.
<replaceregexp> now has an optional encoding attribute to support
replacing in files that are in a different encoding than the
