Changes from Ant 1.9.1 TO 1.9.2
===================================
Fixed bugs:
-----------
* Parsing of zip64 extra fields has become more lenient in order to
be able to read archives created by DotNetZip and maybe other
archivers as well.
* TarInputStream should now properly read GNU longlink entries' names.
Bugzilla Report 55040.
* <java> and <exec> used to be too restrictive when evaluating
whether a given set of options is compatible with spawning the new
process.
Bugzilla Report 55112.
Other changes:
--------------
* <javadoc> will now post-process the generated in order to mitigate
the frame injection attack possible in javadocs generated by Oracle
JDKs prior to Java7 Update 25.
The vulnerability is known as
CVE-2013-1571.
There is an option to turn off the post-processing but it is only
recommended you do so if all your builds use a JDK that's not
vulnerable.
Bugzilla Report 55132.
