Changes from Ant 1.6.1 to Ant 1.6.2
Changes that could break older environments:
The import task used the canonical version of a file path. This
has been changed to use the absolute path. Bugzilla 28505.
ant-xalan2.jar has been removed since the only class contained in it
didn't depend on Xalan-J 2 at all.
Its sole dependency has always
been TraX and so it has been merged into ant-trax.jar.
All exceptions thrown by tasks are now wrapped in a buildexception
giving the location in the buildfile of the task.
Nested elements for namespaced tasks and types may belong to the
Ant default namespace as well as the task's or type's namespace.
<junitreport> will very likely no longer work with Xalan-J 1.
Note that Xalan-J 1 has been deprecated for a very long time and we
highly recommend that you upgrade.
If you really need to continue using Xalan-J 1, please copy the
junit-frames-xalan1.xsl from the distribution's etc directory as
junit-frames.xsl into a new directory and use the task's styledir
attribute to point to.
This is the last version of the XSLT
stylesheet that is expected to be compatible with Xalan-J 1.
Fixed bugs:
eliminate memory leak in AntClassLoader. Bugzilla Report 8689.
subant haltonfailure=false did not catch all failures. Bugzilla Report 27007.
macrodef @@ escaping was broken.

Throw build exception if target repeated in build file, but allow targets
to be repeated in imported files.
<apply> didn't compare timestamps of source and targetfiles when
using a nested <filelist>.
Bugzilla Report 26985.
tagdiff.xml was broken in ant 1.6.1. Bugzilla Report 27057.
if the basedir contained .. or . dirs, and the build file name contained
.. or ., the basedir was set incorrectly. Bugzilla Report 26765.

If <javac> uses gcj and any of the nested <compilerarg>s implies
compilation to native code (like -o or --main), Ant will not pass
the -C switch to gcj.
This means you can now compile to native code
with gcj which has been impossible in Ant < 1.6.2.
<import optional="false"> and <import optional="true">
behaved identically.
<xslt> now sets the context classloader if you've specified a nested
<classpath>.

The OS/2 wrapper scripts have been adapted to use the new launcher.
Bugzilla Report 28226.

Bugzilla Report 28349.
<xslt> now supports a nested <mapper>.
Bugzilla Report 11249.

New "pattern" attribute for <date> selector.
<junit> has a new forkmode attribute that controls the number of
Java VMs that get created when forking tests.
This allows you to
run all tests in a single forked JVM reducing the overhead of VM
creation a lot.

one it currently builds as well.
See the new <indexjars> element

a granularity of two seconds).
The default remains to round up.
Bugzilla Report 17934.
A binary option has been added to <concat>. Bugzilla Report 26312.
Added DynamicConfiguratorNS, an namespace aware version of
DynamicConfigurator. Bugzilla Report 28436.

Bugzilla Report 28340.
Nested file mappers and a container mapper implementation have been
introduced.
Additionally, the <mapper> element now accepts "defined"
nested FileNameMapper implementations directly, allowing a usage
comparable to those of <condition>, <filter>, and <selector>.
New <redirector> type introduced to provide extreme I/O flexibility.
Initial support for <exec>, <apply>, and <java> tasks.
<apply> has a new ignoremissing attribute (default true for BC)
which will allow nonexistent files specified via <filelist>s to
be passed to the executable.

<junitreport> now also works with Xalan XSLTC and/or JDK 1.5.
Bugzilla Report 27541.
<jspc> doesn't work properly with Tomcat 5.x.
We've implemented a
work-around but don't intend to support future changes in Tomcat
5.x.
Please use the jspc task that ships with Tomcat instead of
Ant's.
