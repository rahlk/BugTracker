Release Notes of Apache Ant 1.9.5
Changes from Ant 1.9.4 TO Ant 1.9.5
===================================
Changes that could break older environments:
-------------------------------------------
* The ReplaceTokens filter can now use token-separators longer than
one character.
This means it can be used to replace mustache-style
{{patterns}} and similar templates.
This is going to break code
that invokes the setters on ReplaceTokens via the Java API as their
parameters have been changed from char to String.
It may also
break build files that specified multi character tokens and relied
on Ant silently ignoring all but the first character.
Bugzilla Report 56584
* The changes that added <get>'s support for gzip encoding
automatically uncompressed content that would not have been touched
before - like when downloading .tar.gz files.
A new flag has been
added to control the behavior and its default will make <get> work
as it did in 1.9.3.
I.e. if you want it to work like 1.9.4
you have to explicitly set tryGzipEncoding to true.
Bugzilla Report 57048
Fixed bugs:
-----------
* TarArchiveInputStream failed to read archives with empty gid/uid
fields.
Bugzilla Report 56641
* TarArchiveInputStream could throw IOException when reading PAX
headers from a "slow" InputStream.
* XMLJunitResultFormatter could throw NullPointerException if Java
cannot determine the local hostname.
Bugzilla Report 56593
* URLResource#getLastModified tried to access the connection to the
URL without making sure it was established, potentially leading to
a NullPointerException when using FTP.
Bugzilla Report 56873
* Long-Name and -link or PAX-header entries in TAR archives
always had the current time as last modfication time, creating
archives that are different at the byte level each time an
archive was built.
* runant.py should now work as well when the path of the Java executable
contains spaces.
github pull request #1
* <junitreport> now supports nested <classpath> and <factory> elements.
Bugzilla Report 47002
* complete-ant-cmd.pl now also knows about the -file option.
Bugzilla Report 57371
* the br-replace template inside the XSLT stylesheets used by
<junitreport> could cause stack overflows or out-of-memory errors
when applied to big outputs.
Bugzilla Report 57341
* removed spurious warning about unclosed ZipFiles when reading the
archive failed.
Port of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COMPRESS-297
* FileUtils.rename which is used by several tasks can throw a
NullPointerException if the "normal" renameTo operation fails and
an exception occurs while rename falls back to copying and deleting
the file.
Bugzilla Report 57533
* complete-ant-cmd.pl would incorrectly suggest words from the build
file description.
Bugzilla Report 51931
* complete-ant-cmd.pl now also completes tasks without a description.
Bugzilla Report 57542
* LocalPropertyStack could run into ConcurrentModificationException
when tasks spawned new child threads that accessed the properties.
Bugzilla Report 55074
* TarEntry's constructor with a File and a String arg didn't
normalize the name.
* Between 1.8.4 and 1.9.0 TarInputStream started to parse file
names using the platform's default encoding rather than as ASCII.
This has been a breaking change that has never been marked as such
(in fact it went unnoticed).
In order to allow <untar> and
<tarfileset> to work on platforms who's encoding doesn't match the
encoding of file names inside the archive, both now support
encoding attributes.
The attribute has also been added to <tar> for symmetry.
