the first switch on a command line.
Bugzilla Report 48186.
* <fixcrlf> now tries to delete the created temporary files earlier.
Bugzilla Report 48506.

the jarjar links task and protentially other third-party subclasses
as well.
Bugzilla Report 48541.
* <scp> task didn't report build file location when a remote operation failed
Bugzilla Report 48578.

Changes from Ant 1.7.1 TO Ant 1.8.0RC1
======================================
Changes that could break older environments:
-------------------------------------------
* if and unless attributes (on <target> as well as various tasks and other
elements) have long permitted ${property} interpolation. Now, if the result
evaluates to "true" or "false" (or "yes", "no", "on", "off"), that boolean
value will be used; otherwise the traditional behavior of treating the value
as a property name (defined ~ true, undefined ~ false) is used. Existing
scripts could be broken if they perversely defined a property named "false"
and expected if="false" to be true, or used if="true" expecting this to be
triggered only if a property named "true" were defined.
* Ant now requires Java 1.4 or later.
* Improved handling of InterruptException (lets suppose someone/thing
is trying to kill the thread when we receive an
InterruptException), when an InterruptException is received, we do
not wait anymore in a while loop till the end time has been
reached.
Bugzilla Report 42924.
* Refactor PropertyHelper and introspection APIs to make extension
more granular and support setting task/type attribute values to
objects decoded by custom PropertyEvaluator delegates. Also add
<propertyhelper> task for registering delegates and/or replacing
the registered PropertyHelper instance.
Bugzilla Report 42736.
* Added a restricted form of typedef called <componentdef>. This
allows definition of elements that can only be within tasks or
types. This method is now used to define conditions, selectors,
comparators and filterreaders. This means that tasks may now have
nested conditions just by implementing the Condition interface,
rather than extending ConditionBase. It also means that the use of
namespaces for some of the selectors introduced in Ant 1.7.0 is no
longer necessary.
Implementing this means that the DynamicElement
work-around introduced in Ant 1.7.0 has been removed.
Bugzilla Report 40511.
* In the <touch> task when a <mapper> is used, the millis and
datetime attributes now override the time of the source resource if
provisioned.
Bugzilla Report 43235.
* Remove fall-back mechanism for references that are not resolved
during normal runtime execution.
* FileUtils.createTempFile now actually creates the file.
The TempFile task still does not create the file by default, can be
instructed to do so however using a new parameter.
Bugzilla Report 33969.
* A lock in Project ensured that a BuildListener's messageLogged
method was only ever executed by a single thread at a time, while
all other methods could be invoked by multiple threads
simultaniously (while within <parallel>, for example).
This lock
is no longer in place, messageLogged should be made thread-safe
now.
* <sql>'s onError="stop" no longer fails the build if an error
occurs,
this is the main difference between stop and error and
matches what the documentation implied.
Bugzilla Report 24668.
* Ant's configuration introspection mechanisms have been modified to prefer
Resource and FileProvider attributes to plain java.io.File attributes;
however the configuration-from-String behavior remains equivalent, rendering
a FileResource.
* CBZip2InputStream will now throw an IOException if
passed in a null or empty InputStream to read from.
Bugzilla Reports 32200.
* <unzip> will now fail when trying to extract certain broken
archives that would have been silently ignored in earlier version.
Bugzilla Report 35000.
* Ant's <zip> family of tasks tries to preserve the existing Unix
permissions when updating archives or copying entries from one
archive to another.
Since not all archiving tools support storing Unix permissions in
the same way that is used by Ant, sometimes the permissions read by
Ant seem to be 0, which means nobody is allowed to do anything to
the file or directory.
If Ant now encounters a permission set of 0 it will assume that
this is not the intended value and instead apply its own default
values.
Ant used to create entries with 0 permissions itself.
The <zip> family of tasks has a new attribute preserve0permissions
that can be set to restore the old behavior.
Bugzilla Report 42122.
* If a batch containing multiple JUnit tests running inside a forked
Java VM caused the VM to crash (or caused a timeout), the
formatters would receive an error message for the last test in the
batch.
Ant will now pass in a test with the name "Batch-With-Multiple-Tests"
instead - this is supposed to show more clearly that the last test
may not have started at all.
Bugzilla Report 45227.
* If the number of minutes a build takes is bigger then 1000 Ant will
no longer print a thousands separator in the "elapsed time"
message.
It used to be the thousands separator of the current
locale.
Bugzilla Report 44659.
* <symlink action="delete"> used to fail if the link was broken (i.e.
pointing to a file or directory that no longer existed).
It will now
silently try to remove the link.
Bugzilla Report 41285.
* <delete file="..."> used to log a warning and not delete broken
symbolic links.
<delete dir="..."/> didn't even log a warning.
The task will now try to delete them in both cases.
Bugzilla Report 41285.
* if the dir attribute of a <fileset> points to a symbolic link and
followsymlinks is set to false, the fileset will no longer be
scanned and always seem empty.
Bugzilla Report 45741.
* the .NET tasks that have been deprecated since Ant 1.7.0 have been
removed, please use the stand-alone Antlib you can find at
http://ant.apache.org/antlibs/dotnet/index.html
instead.
* the logic of closing streams connected to forked processes (read
the input and output of <exec> and friends) has been changed to
deal with cases where child processes of the forked processes live
longer than their parents and keep Ant from exiting.
It is unlikely but possible that the changed logic breaks stream
handling on certain Java VMs.
Bugzilla issue 5003.
* <checksum>'s totalproperty was platform dependent because it relied
on java.io.File#compareTo.
It has now been made platform
independent, which means that totalPropery values obtained on
Windows (and other systems where the sort order of File is not case
sensitive) can be different from the values obtained with earlier
versions of Ant.
Bugzilla Report 36748.
* globmapper didn't work properly if the "to" or "from" patterns
didn't contain a "*".
In particular it implicitly added a * to the
end of the pattern(s).
This is no longer the case.
If you relied
on this behavior you will now need to explicitly specify the
trailing "*".
Bugzilla Report 46506.
* <copy> silently ignored missing resources even with
failOnError="true".
If your build tries to copy non-existant
resources and you relied on this behavior you must now explicitly
set failOnError to false.
Bugzilla Report 47362.
* Ant now prefers the java.runtime.version system property over
java.vm.version for the Created-By Manifest attribute.
Bugzilla Report 47632.
* The <image> task now supports a nested mapper.
In order to
implement this, the Java API of the task had to change so any
custom subclass overriding the processFile method will need to
adapt (by overriding the new two-arg processFile method).
Bugzilla Report 23243.
* A new property syntax can be used to set attributes from
references: ${ant.ref:some-reference}
In most cases this will yield the exact same result as
${toString:some-reference} - only when an attribute setter method
accepts an object type other than string and the project's
reference is an Object of matching type the new syntax will pass in
that object.
If your build file already contains properties whose name starts
with "ant.ref:" there is a potential for collision.
If your
property has been set, normal property expansion will take
precedence over the new syntax.
If the property has not been set
and a reference with the postfix of your property name exists
(i.e. in a very unlikely event) then the new syntax would yield a
different result (an expanded property) than Ant 1.7.1 did.
* A ProjectHelper implementation can now provide the default build file
name it is expecting, and can specify if they can support a specific build
file. So Ant is now capable of supporting several ProjectHelper
implementations, deciding on which to use depending of the input build file.
* Mapper-aware selectors (depends, different, present) now accept typedef'd
FileNameMappers.
Fixed bugs:
-----------
* The default logger was failing to print complete stack traces for
exceptions other than BuildException when inside <ant> or
<antcall>, thus omitting often important diagnostic
information.
Bugzilla 43398 (continued).
* Better handling of package-info.class.
Bugzilla Report 43114.

Bugzilla Report 43426.
* <symlink> task failonerror="false" does not stop build from failing
when 'ln' command returns non-zero.
Bugzilla Report 43624
* <touch> task couldn't differentiate between "no resources
specified" and "no resources matched."
Bugzilla Report 43799.

file system root.
Bugzilla Report 44499.
* <globmapper> had an indexoutofbounds when the prefix and postfix
overlapped.
Bugzilla Report 44731.
* <typedef> and <taskdef> failed to accept file names with #
characters in them.
Bugzilla Report 45190
* A deadlock could occur if a BuildListener tried to access an Ant property
within messageLogged while a different thread also accessed one.
Bugzilla Report 45194
* Handle null result of system getProperty() in CommandlineJava.
Similar to Bugzilla Report 42334.
* Length task did not process nonexistent Resources even though these might
conceivably still carry file length information.
Bugzilla Report 45271.
* <javac>'s includeJavaRuntime="false" should work for gcj now.
Note
that you may need to set includeAntRuntime to false in order to
have full control.
Bugzilla Report 34638.
* <sql> would fail if the executed statment didn't return a result
set with some JDBC driver that dissalow Statement.getResultSet to
be called in such a situation.
Bugzilla Report 36265
* if the executed statement in <sql> returned a result set and an
update count, the count would be lost.
* if an executed statement in <sql> mixes update count and result set
parts, some result sets wouldn't get printed.
Bugzilla Report 32168.

* ant -v -version would print the version information twice.
Bugzilla Report 45695.
* when nested into builds that have been invoked by <ant> tasks
<subant> might set the wrong basedir on the called projects.
Bugzilla Report 30569.
* If the message of the failed assertion of a forked JUnit test
contained line feeds some excess output ended up in Ant's log.
Bugzilla Report 45411.
* <symlink action="delete"> failed to delete a link that pointed to
a parent directory.
Bugzilla Report 45743.
* <symlink action="delete"> failed if ant lacked permission to rename
the link's target.
Bugzilla Report 41525.
* when checking whether a jar is signed, <signjar> ignored the

* <javadoc> failed if the nested <bottom> or <head> contained line
breaks.
Bugzilla Report 43342.

worked if JavaMail was available.
Bugzilla Report 42389.
* MailLogger could cause a NullPointerException.
Bugzilla Report 44009.
* <junit> didn't recognize failed assertions as failures if they
caused subclasses of AssertionError to be thrown (like
org.junit.ComparisonFailure that is thrown when assertEquals
fails).
Bugzilla Report 45028.
* the Unix "ant" wrapper script failed to protect wildcards in
command line arguments in some cases.
Bugzilla Report 31601.
* <cvstagdiff> crippled file names and could miss some entries if
multiple modules have been specified.
Bugzilla Report 35301.
* Tasks with a "public void add(SomeType)" method failed to work as
TaskContainers at the same time.
Bugzilla Report 41647.

work as TaskContainers at the same time.
Bugzilla Report 41647.
* combining SSL and authentication in <mail> and MailLogger failed in
some setups.
Bugzilla Report 46063.
* if an error occurs while logging the buildFinished event, the
original error is now logged to System.err.
Bugzilla Report 25086.
* <copy> failed with a NullPointerException when copying a resource
without a name.
It will now fail with a meaningful error message.
Bugzilla Report 39960.
* <xslt> now uses the configured classpath to load the factory (when
using TraX) before falling back to Ant's own classpath.
Bugzilla Report 46172.
* <dependset> complained about files being modified in the future if
they had been just very recently (within Ant's assumed granularity
of the file system).
Bugzilla Report 43665.
* <sshexec> didn't store the ouput in outputproperty if the remote
command failed.
Bugzilla Report 46340.
* DirectoryScanner's slow-scanning algorithm that is used when you
ask for excluded or not-included files and/or directories could
miss some files and directories in the presence of recursive
exclude patterns.
* <sort> resource collection kept only one of entries deemed equal by
the chosen Comparator.
Bugzilla Report 46527.
* the ZipFile class used by <unzip> and others could leave the
archive open (making it undeletable on Windows as long as the java
VM was running) for files with an unexpected internal structure.
Bugzilla Report 46559.
* The zip package now supports the extra fields invented by InfoZIP
in order to store Unicode file names and comments.
* The zip package detects the encoding bit set by more modern
archivers when they write UTF-8 filenames and optionally sets it
when writing zips or jars.
Bugzilla Report 45548
* <sync> could run into a NullPointerException when faced with broken
symbolic links.
Bugzilla Report 46747.
* The ant shell script should now support MSYS/MinGW as well.
Bugzilla Report 46936.
* <signjar> has a new force attribute that allows re-signing of jars
that are already signed.
Bugzilla Report 46891.
* <sshexec> now again honors failonerror in the face of connection
errors.
Bugzilla Report 46829.
* The <replacetokens> filter threw an exception if the stream to
filter ended with a begin token.
Bugzilla Report 47306.
* <scriptmapper>, <scriptfilter> and <scriptcondition> didn't support
the setbeans attribute.
Bugzilla Report 47336.
* <loadproperties>' encoding attribute didn't work.
Bugzilla Report 47382.
* Ant created tar archives could contain random bytes at the end
which confused some untar implementations.
Bugzilla Report 47421.
* various places where unchecked PrintWriters could hide exceptions
have been revisited to now check the error status or not use a
PrintWriter at all.
Bugzilla Report 43537.
* filesetmanifest="mergewithoutmain" in <jar> didn't treat inline
manifests as expected.
Bugzilla Report 29731.
* <record> didn't work properly with nested builds.
Bugzilla Report 41368.
* <jar> with filesetmanifest different from skip didn't work if the
update attribute has been set to true.
Bugzilla Report 30751.
* The default stylesheets for <junitreport> failed to properly escape
XML content in exception stack traces.
Bugzilla Report 39492.
* AntClassLoader didn't set the proper CodeSource for loaded classes.
Bugzilla Report 20174.
* AntClassLoader.getResourceAsStream would return streams to
resources it didn't return with getResource and to classes it
failed to load.
Bugzilla Report 44103.
* Logging exceptions without a message would cause a
NullPointerException.
Bugzilla Report 47623.
* WeblogicDeploymentTool could fail on platforms with a file
separator other than "/".
Bugzilla Report 35649.
* The update attribute of the modified selector was ignored.
Bugzilla Report 32597.
* <manifest> and <jar> can now merge Class-Path attributes from
multiple sources and optionally flatten them into a single
attribute.
The default behaviour still is to keep multiple Class-Path
attributes if they have been specified and to only include the
attributes of the last merged manifest.
Bugzilla Report 39655.
* <delete> didn't work correctly with a <modified> selector because
it was scanning the same filesets more than once.
Bugzilla Report 43574.
* when using custom filterreaders with the <filterreader classname="">
syntax Ant could leak memory.
The problem didn't occur when using <typedef> or <componentdef> to
define the filterreader which is the recommended approach.
Bugzilla Report 45439.
* Ant didn't set the proper "magic" value for tar entries containing
long file names in GNU longfile mode.
Bugzilla Report 47653.
* The tar task failed to recognize that the archive had to be
(re-)created in some cases where the sources are filesystem based
resources but not filesets.
Bugzilla Report 48035.
* <sshexec>'s outputproperty was prefixed by the executed command
when the command attribute has been used, breaking backwards
compatibility to Ant 1.7.0.
Bugzilla Report 48040.
* different task instances of the same <scriptdef>ed tasks could
overwrite each others attributes/nested elements.
Bugzilla Report 41602.

fail to read the file(s) completely.
Bugzilla Report 48313.
Other changes:
--------------
* The get task now also follows redirects from http to https
Bugzilla Report 47433
* A HostInfo task was added performing information on hosts, including info on
the host ant is running on.
Bugzilla Reports 45861 and 31164.
* There is now a FileProvider interface for resources that act as a source
of filenames. This should be used by tasks that require resources
to provide filenames, rather than require that all resources
are instances or subclasses of FileResource.
Bugzilla Report 43348
* There is now a URLProvider interface for resources that act as a
source of URLs. This should be used by tasks that require resources
to provide URLs, rather than require that all resources are
instances or subclasses of URLResource.
* Fixcrlf now gives better error messages on bad directory attributes.
Bugzilla Report 43936
* a new property ant.project.default-target holds the value of the
current <project>'s default attribute.
* a new property ant.project.invoked-targets holds a comma separated
list of the targets that have been specified on the command line
(the IDE, an <ant> task ...) when invoking the current project.
* The <type> resource selector has had an "any" type added for better
configurability.
* Ant should detect the OS as both a Mac and a Unix system when
running on OpenJDK.
Bugzilla Report 44889.
* new protected getConnection and getStatement methods allow
subclasses of SQLExec more control - or access to the cached
instances when overriding other methods like runStatements.
Bugzilla Report 27178.
* <sql> has a new failOnConnectionError attribute that can be used to
keep a build going even if the task failed to connect to the
database.
Bugzilla Report 36712.
* A new attribute strictDelimiterMatching can be used to ignore case
or whitespace differences when <sql> searches for delimiters.
This is useful if you execute a SQL script that has contains "GO"
and "go" as delimiters.
Bugzilla Report 26459.
* A new showWarnings attribute of <sql> allows warnings to be logged.
Bugzilla Report 41836.
* A new treatWarningsAsErrors attribute of <sql> can be used to fail
a build if a warning occurs.
Bugzilla Report 41836.
* Ant now supports scoped properties (see Local task).
Bugzilla Report 23942.
* <sql>'s CSV output can be controlled via the new attributes
csvColumnSeparator and csvQuoteCharacter.
Bugzilla Report 35627.
* <ftp>'s logging has been improved.
Bugzilla Reports 30932, 31743.
* It is now possible to disable <ftp>'s remote verification.
Bugzilla Report 35471.
* <sshexec> now supports input in a way similar to <exec>
Bugzilla Report 39197.
* <scp> can now preserve the file modification time when downloading
files.
Bugzilla Report 33939.
* the new task sshsession can run multiple tasks in the presence of
an SSH session providing (local and remote) tunnels.
Bugzilla Report 43083.
* ZipOutputStream has been sped up for certain usage scenarios that
are not used by Ant's family of zip tasks.
Bugzilla Report 45396.
* <echo> supports an "output" Resource attribute as an alternative to "file".
* <sql> "output" attribute now supports any Resource in addition to a file.
* <scp> no longer requires a passphrase when using key based
authentication.
Bugzilla Report 33718.
* a new failOnEmptyArchive attribute on <unzip> and <untar> can now
make the task fail the build if it tries to extract an empty
archive.
* <unzip> and <untar> have a new attribute stripAbsolutePathSpec.
When set to true, Ant will remove any leading path separator from
the archived entry's name before extracting it (making the name a
relative file name).
Bugzilla Report 28911.
* <unzip> will now detect that it was asked to extract a file that is
not an archive earlier if the file is big.
Bugzilla Report 45463.
* New file and resource selectors <readable/> and <writable/> have
been added that select file which the current process can read or
write.
Bugzilla Report 45081.
* The filename file selector has a new attribute regex that allows
files to be selected by matching their names against a regular
expression.
Bugzilla Report 45284
* The name resource selector has a new attribute regex that allows
resources to be selected by matching their names against a regular
expression.
Bugzilla Report 45284
* Enhanced performance of Project.fireMessageLoggedEvent and DirectoryScanner
Bugzilla Reports 45651 and 45665
* The package list location for offline links can now be specified as
an URL.
Bugzilla Report 28881
* <echoxml> now supports XML namespaces.
Bugzilla Report 36804.
* A new listener for <junit> has been added that tries to invoke the
tearDown method of a TestCase if that TestCase was run in a forked
VM and the VM crashed or a timeout occured.
See the <junit> task's
manual page for details.
Bugzilla Report 37241.
* The Jar task now supports the addition of a jar index file in update mode.
Previously the absence of the index was not enough to trigger the rebuild;
some other update was necessary.
Bugzilla report 45098.
* <ant> has a new attribute "useNativeBasedir" that makes the child
build use the same basedir it would have used if invoked from the
command line.
No matter what other attributes/properties have been
set.
Bugzilla Report 45711.
* <patch> has a new optional failOnError attribute.
Bugzilla Report 44772.
* Antlib descriptors will now be parsed by the configured
ProjectHelper if the implementation overrides the new
canParseAntlibDescriptor and parseAntlibDescriptor methods.
If the
configured helper doesn't override the methods, a new instance of
ProjectHelper2 will be used just like in Ant 1.7.1.
Bugzilla Report 42208.
* It is now possible to explicitly set the executable used by
<signjar>.
Bugzilla Report 39189.
* <compositemapper>'s order of results is now predictable.
Bugzilla Report 44873
* a new <firstmatchmapper> has been added, which works similar to
<compositemapper> but only returns the results of the first nested
mapper that matches.
Bugzilla Report 44873
* <get> has a new maxtime attribute that terminates downloads that
are taking too long.
Bugzilla Report 45181.
* <ftp> now supports selectors for remote directories as well.
Bugzilla Report 44726.
* In some cases Ant fails to rename files if the source or target
file has just recently been closed on Windows.
It will now try to
delete the offending file once again after giving the Java VM time
to really close the file.
Bugzilla Report 45960.
* two new properties can be used to set the MIME-Type and charset
used by MailLogger.
Bugzilla Report 27211.
* a new attribute of <mail> allows the task to succeed if it can
reach at least one given recipient.
Bugzilla Report 36446.
* two new properties allow MailLogger to send a fixed text instead of
the log file.
Bugzilla Report 38029.
* <cvsversion> is supposed to support CVSNT now.
Bugzilla Report 31409.
* <cvs>' port attribute should now work for all clients that use the
environment variable CVS_PSERVER_PORT instead of the "official"
CVS_CLIENT_PORT.
Bugzilla Report 30124.
* <cvsversion> now works for local repositories as well.
* <cvstagdiff> has an option to ignore removed files now.
Bugzilla Report 26257.
* <cvs> and friends now support modules with spaces in their names
via nested <module> elements.
* A new attribute "ignoreEmpty" controls how <concat> deals when
there are no resources to concatenate.
If it is set to false, the
destination file will be created regardless, which reinstates the
behavior of Ant 1.7.0.
Bugzilla Report 46010.
* If the new remote attribute is set to true, <cvschangelog> can now
work against a remote repository without any working copy.
Bugzilla Report 27419.
* start and end tags can now be used instead of dates in
<cvschangelog>.
Bugzilla Report 27419.
* MailLogger and <mail> can now optionally enable support for
STARTTLS.
Bugzilla Report 46063.
* <import> has new attributes "as" and "prefixSeparator" that can be
used to control the prefix prepended to the imported targets'
names.
* a new task <include> provides an alternative to <import> that
should be preferred when you don't want to override any targets.

If set to
true, symbolic links not followed (because followSymlinks was false
or the number of symlinks was too big) will be removed.
Bugzilla Report 36658.

<attrib> can now be used to run the commands on operating systems
other than their "native" environment, i.e. non-Unix or non-Windows
operating systems respectively.
Bugzilla Report 7624.

This can be used to enable XInclude
processing in Xerces, for example.
Bugzilla Report 36653.
* a new resource collection <archives> can be used to specify
collections of ZIP and TAR archives as sources.
It extracts them on
the fly.

full filesystem.
Bugzilla Report 32676.
* <pathconvert> has a new preserveduplicates attribute--historically
these were eliminated in the interest of behaving in the manner
of a "path."
* <javac>'s source and target attributes are no longer ignored when
using gcj.
Bugzilla Issue 46617.

processor.
Bugzilla Issue 46612.

a size.
Bugzilla Report 42940.
* CBZip2OutputStream now has a finish method separate from close.
Bugzilla Report 42713.

different executable.
Bugzilla Report 42132.
* <javac>, <rmic>, <javah> and <native2ascii> now provide a nested
element to specify a classpath that will be used when loading the
task's (compiler) adapter class.
Bugzilla Report 11143.
* <javac>, <rmic>, <javah> and <native2ascii> now provide a nested
element to specify the task's (compiler) adapter as an instance of
a class that has been defined via typedef/componentdef.
This
allows more control over the classpath and allows adapters to be
defined in Antlibs easily.
* A new subclass org.apache.tools.ant.loader.AntClassLoader5 of
AntClassLoader has been added which overrides getResources
which became non-final in ClassLoader with Java5+ so
this method now behaves as expected.
The new subclass will be used by Ant internally if it is available
and Ant is running on Java5 or more recent.
Bugzilla Report 46752.

* <path> can now optionally cache its contents.
* <property> can now specify values as nested text.
Bugzilla Report 32917.

be loaded from the specified classpath rather than the system
classloader.
Bugzilla Report 41369.
* <property location="from" basedir="to" relative="true"/> can now
calculate relative paths.
* The <name> selector supports a new handleDirSep attribute that
makes it ignore differences between / and \ separators.
Bugzilla Report 47858.
* <get> now supports resource collections (as long as the resources
contained provide URLs) and can get multiple resources in a single
task.
* <import> can now import non-File resources if they provide an URL
- as the <url> and <javaresource> resources do.
Bugzilla Report 29251
* <import> can now import multiple resources specified as resource
